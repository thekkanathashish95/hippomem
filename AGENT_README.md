## 1. What is hippomem (product overview)

hippomem is a brain-inspired persistent memory layer for LLM chat applications. It sits between your chat application and your LLM: before every AI response, it retrieves relevant memories and injects them into the system prompt; after every turn, it encodes what happened into a structured memory store. Over time, it consolidates memories by decaying stale events, clustering related ones, and synthesizing stable user traits — mimicking how the human hippocampus transfers short-term experience into long-term knowledge.

The design is intentionally different from a fact store or RAG pipeline. hippomem models **selective forgetting**: memories decay if unused, get promoted and demoted based on relevance, and are organized as a weighted graph of episodic events — not a flat list of documents. The retrieval cascade (C1→C2→C3) mirrors biological memory: check if the current conversation is still in context, scan working memory, escalate to long-term semantic search only when needed.

The long-term vision is a **shared cross-app memory store**: one persistent memory layer that follows a user across multiple LLM applications. Current stage: **v0.2, functional, alpha-quality**.

## 3. The four public operations

### `decode(user_id, message, session_id=None, conversation_history=[]) → DecodeResult`
Called **before** each LLM response. Retrieves relevant memories and returns a `DecodeResult` with a `.context` string to inject into the LLM system prompt. Internally runs a three-stage cascade: **C1** checks if the conversation is a continuation (LLM call, fast); **C2** scans working memory for a high-confidence local hit; **C3** escalates to FAISS + graph semantic search when C1/C2 don't resolve. `decode()` degrades silently — if retrieval fails, it returns empty context rather than raising.

- **Main module**: `hippomem/decoder/synthesizer.py` (`ContextSynthesizer`)
- **Codeflow**: `docs/codeflows/decode.md`

### `encode(user_id, user_message, assistant_response, decode_result=None) → None`
Called **after** each LLM response. Updates the memory store with what happened. Runs extraction, de-duplication, scoring, and working-memory promotion. Also handles entity extraction (people, pets, orgs → `EngramLink(kind=mention)`) and self-trait extraction (`SelfTrait` rows). Uses a 4-tier decode-link strategy to connect new memories to existing ones before persisting.

- **Main module**: `hippomem/encoder/updater.py` (`WorkingMemoryUpdater`)
- **Codeflow**: `docs/codeflows/encode.md`

### `consolidate(user_id) → None`
Called **periodically** (not every turn). Runs four maintenance steps in order: (1) compresses accumulated pending episode update statements into each episode's clean consolidated baseline; (2) enriches entity profiles by merging pending facts and updating summaries; (3) prunes stale self-traits; (4) synthesizes all active self-traits into a structured identity Persona `Engram(kind=persona)`. Decay and demotion are handled by the encoder on each turn — not here. Can run as a background asyncio task when `enable_background_consolidation=True`.

- **Main module**: `hippomem/consolidator/service.py` (`ConsolidationService`)
- **Codeflow**: `docs/codeflows/consolidate.md`

### `retrieve(user_id, query, mode="hybrid", top_k=5) → RetrieveResult`
**Optional** direct search API — bypasses the C1/C2/C3 cascade and returns raw engram results. Supports `mode="hybrid"` (FAISS + BM25), `mode="semantic"` (FAISS only), or `mode="bm25"`. Results include per-episode enrichment. Unlike `decode()`, `retrieve()` propagates exceptions rather than degrading silently.

- **Main module**: `hippomem/retrieve/service.py` (`RetrieveService`)
- **Codeflow**: `docs/codeflows/retrieve.md`

---

## 4. Three memory types

**Episodic** — facts, events, preferences, and observations extracted from conversations. Stored as `Engram(kind="episode")` rows. The primary memory type; most encode operations produce episodic engrams.

**Entity** — named individuals (people, pets, organizations) encountered in conversations. Stored as `Engram(kind="entity")` with `EngramLink(kind="mention")` edges connecting entities to the episodes that mention them. Entity extraction runs during `encode()` via `memory/entity/llm_ops.py`.

**Self / Persona** — stable user identity signals accumulated across turns. Raw signals are stored as `SelfTrait` rows. Extraction is confidence-gated: `confidence >= 0.8` activates immediately; `0.6–0.8` stays inactive until a second independent observation; `< 0.6` is skipped entirely. `consolidate()` synthesizes all active traits into a structured identity `Engram(kind="persona")` — category-by-category Markdown, proportional length, no word limit — injected into decode context. Traits observed after the last consolidation are appended inline by the decoder as a pending block, so fresh signals are visible immediately without waiting for the next consolidation run.

---

## 5. Data model (key tables)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Engram` | Central memory unit — episodes, entities, personas, summaries; has strength, embedding, kind |
| `EngramLink` | Weighted typed graph edges — kinds: similarity, temporal, retrieval-co-occurrence, triadic, mention |
| `WorkingState` | Per-user/session active + dormant engram UUID lists; single-row cache per user |
| `Trace` | Ephemeral pre-memory weak traces; FIFO buffer, evicted when at capacity |
| `SelfTrait` | Durable identity signals accumulated turn-by-turn (name, habits, preferences, etc.) |
| `LLMInteraction` | One Inspector trace record per operation (decode/encode/consolidate) |
| `LLMCallLog` | One record per individual LLM API call within an operation |
| `TurnStatus` | Real-time decode/encode phase tracking rows; polled via SSE by Studio Chat |
| `ConversationTurn` | Raw turn storage (user + assistant message pairs) |
| `ConversationTurnEngram` | Junction table: which engrams were active/created during which turn |

Full column specs and relationships: `docs/codeflows/models.md`

---

## 6. Infrastructure services

These shared services are wired in `MemoryService.setup()` and passed into subcomponents. Know they exist and where they live before adding any new LLM, embedding, or search logic.

| Service | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `LLMService` | `infra/llm.py` | OpenAI-compatible HTTP client with retries and exponential backoff |
| `EmbeddingService` | `infra/embeddings.py` | Embedding calls (text-embedding-3-small); same endpoint as LLM |
| `FAISSService` | `infra/vector/faiss_service.py` | Per-user FAISS index; lazy-loaded, persisted to disk |
| `BM25Retriever` | `infra/bm25.py` | TTL-cached per-user keyword index; rebuilt from engrams on cache miss |
| `LLMCallCollector` | `infra/call_collector.py` | Context variable; automatically captures all LLM calls within an operation without being passed explicitly |
| Graph queries | `infra/graph/queries.py` | Traversal helpers, clustering queries; used by consolidator and decoder |

---

## 7. Configuration

`MemoryConfig` in `hippomem/config.py` is the **single source of truth** for all algorithm parameters. It is a `@dataclass` with documented fields covering working memory capacity, decay rates, retrieval thresholds, edge weights, consolidation intervals, and feature flags.

Module-level constants (e.g., `DEFAULT_EDGE_SIMILARITY_ALPHA`, `DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_SEMANTIC_WEIGHT`) at the top of `config.py` are imported by `infra/graph/edges.py` and `infra/vector/edges.py` to stay synchronized.

**Library mode**: instantiate `MemoryConfig()` and pass to `MemoryService(config=...)`.

**Daemon mode**: env vars from `.env` (copy from `.env.example`). The Studio Settings page can write overrides to `hippomem_config.json` (takes priority over `.env`; no restart needed).

**Prompts** are YAML files in `hippomem/prompts/` — never hardcoded strings. Add new prompts there.

Full parameter table: `docs/guides/configuration.md`

---

## 8. Key design decisions / conventions

These are conventions an agent must not accidentally violate:

- **`WorkingState.load()` and `.persist()`** are the only places that read/write the working state ORM record. Never bypass these methods.
- **`EmbeddingService` is passed directly to `WorkingMemoryUpdater`** — not through `LLMMemoryOperations` or any LLM ops class. Keep embedding calls separate from LLM call classes.
- **`LLMCallCollector` is a context variable** — it auto-captures all LLM calls within an operation. You never need to pass it manually; just ensure operations run within the context set up by `MemoryService`.
- **`decode()` degrades silently; `retrieve()` propagates exceptions.** This is intentional: memory retrieval should never break a chat application, but direct search failures should surface to the caller.
- **Background consolidation is opt-in.** `MemoryConfig.enable_background_consolidation` defaults to `False`. Don't enable it in tests.
- **Edge weight constants live in `config.py`** as `DEFAULT_EDGE_*` fields. Import from `config.py` — don't define weights locally in graph or vector modules.
- **Prompts are YAML, not f-strings.** All LLM prompt templates live in `hippomem/prompts/*.yaml`. Load via the prompt loader utility; don't embed prompt text in Python files.

---

## 9. Daemon server (`hippomem serve`)

The daemon exposes hippomem as a local HTTP service with the Studio UI.

- **FastAPI app**: `hippomem/server/app.py` — all routes defined here
- **Static UI**: `hippomem/server/static/` — pre-built React SPA (source not in this repo)
- **CLI entry**: `hippomem serve --port 8719 --host 127.0.0.1` (argparse in `hippomem/cli.py`)
- **Runtime config**: `.env` is the base; `hippomem_config.json` overrides (written by Settings tab)
- **Per-process state**: `_conversation_histories` dict keyed by `user_id`, held in server memory (not persisted across restarts)

**Key API groups:**
- `/api/decode`, `/api/encode` — main memory operations
- `/api/consolidate` — trigger consolidation
- `/api/retrieve` — direct search
- `/api/memory/*` — Memory Explorer (list, get, update, delete engrams)
- `/api/self` — Self traits and persona
- `/api/inspector` — LLMInteraction traces
- `/api/traces` — Ephemeral trace inspection
- `/api/config` (GET/PATCH) — Read/write runtime config
- `/api/health` — Health check

**SSE**: `TurnStatus` rows are written during decode/encode phases. Studio Chat polls them for real-time progress display.

Codeflow: `docs/codeflows/server.md`

---

## 10. Studio UI

The Studio is a React SPA served from `hippomem/server/static/`. The built assets are in this repo; the React source is not.

**7 pages:**
- **Dashboard** — memory stats overview
- **Chat** — send messages, stream SSE `TurnStatus` progress, see memory working in real time
- **Memory Explorer** — list/grid/graph views; D3 force-directed graph of engram relationships
- **Self** — view and manage self traits and persona narrative
- **Inspector (Traces)** — browse `LLMInteraction` + `LLMCallLog` records per operation
- **Settings** — edit config values; writes to `/api/config` PATCH (no restart needed)
- **Personas** — persona narrative history

**Global state**: `user_id` session context is shared across all pages.

**Chat flow**: user sends message → POST `/api/decode` → poll SSE `TurnStatus` → POST `/api/encode` → render response + memory updates.
